### Installing Chrome
#### Linux
Run the following as a superuser in a terminal:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libappindicator1 fonts-liberation
mkdir temp
cd temp
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i google-chrome*.deb
```

### Installing Chromedriver
#### Linux
1. Before installing Chromedriver, run:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y unzip xvfb libxi6 libgconf-2-4
sudo apt-get install default-jdk 
```
2. Go to [https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/home](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/home).
3. Under the heading "All versions available in Downloads", click on the link next to "Latest stable release".
4. Download your operating system's Chromedriver. Assumably it is in the `Downloads` folder.
5. Navigate to the downloads folder.
6. Unzip the `zip` file using `unzip chromedriver_*.zip`
7. Run the following commands:
```bash
sudo mv chromedriver /usr/bin/chromedriver
sudo chown root:root /usr/bin/chromedriver
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/chromedriver
```

### Main Installation Process
1. Download the repository and extract it into a folder. Let's call that folder the *Root Folder*.
2. Using a terminal, navigate to the *Root Folder*
3. **(Optional)** Create a virtual environment. Run the following commands:
```bash
python -m venv venv --prompt "Good Morning Image Finder"
source venv/bin/activate
```
4. Install the needed libraries by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuring the Project For Your Needs
1. Within the *Root Directory*, create two things:
    - The first is a file named `settings.yaml`.
    - The second is a directory named `imgs`.
2. Copy and paste the following text into `settings.yaml`:
```
send_email:
  email_host: smtp.gmail.com
  email_user: your_email_here@gmail.com
  email_password: your_email_password
  email_port: 587

receive_email:
  recipients:
    - recipient_1@example.com
    - recipient_2@example.com
    - recipient_3@example.com
```
3. Replace `your_email_here@gmail.com` and `your_email_password` with your Gmail email address and password.
4. By replacing the example recipients in the `recipients` list, add in the recipients that you want to send the email to.
5. Next, open up `main.py`. Under `# CONSTANTS`, change the values of the variables as you wish.

## Running the Project
**Note: Read *Configuring the Project For Your Needs* first!**
While inside the *Root Directory* (and within your virtual environment, if you have created one), run:
```bash
python main.py
```
